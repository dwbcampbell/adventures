# Adventures using ChatGPT

The document is built using Quarto.

1. Install Quarto, using the appropriate method for the platform. (I'm using MacOS and I installed Quarto 1.2.313 from a dmg file, but the brew version is up to date. )
2. Use pip to install jupyter
   1. Create a virtual environment 
        - python -m venv venv
        - source venv/bin/activate
   2. I had trouble running with the latest jupyter, so I pinned the required packages in requirements.txt
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
